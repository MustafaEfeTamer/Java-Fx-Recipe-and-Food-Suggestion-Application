##### Here, the main screen of the application welcomes you. This screen displays all the recipes available in the app. When you click on a specific recipe, it shows you a list of its ingredients, along with the recipe name, category, preparation time, ingredient cost, and cooking instructions. The green or red color displayed on each recipe indicates whether you can make the recipe based on the ingredients and quantities available in your kitchen. If the recipe is shown in green, it means you have enough ingredients and quantities to prepare it; if itâ€™s red, it indicates that the available ingredients and amounts are insufficient to make that recipe.
