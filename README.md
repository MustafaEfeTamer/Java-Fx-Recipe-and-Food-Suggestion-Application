##### Here, the main screen of the application welcomes you. This screen displays all the recipes available in the app. When you click on a specific recipe, it shows you a list of its ingredients, along with the recipe name, category, preparation time, ingredient cost, and cooking instructions. The green or red color displayed on each recipe indicates whether you can make the recipe based on the ingredients and quantities available in your kitchen. If the recipe is shown in green, it means you have enough ingredients and quantities to prepare it; if itâ€™s red, it indicates that the available ingredients and amounts are insufficient to make that recipe. Additionally, at the top right, there is a button that goes to the 'recipe operations menu' page and a button that goes to the 'recipe suggestion and dynamic search' page.

##### When you click the 'Recipe Operations Menu' button, you are directed to this page, which is the 'Recipe Addition Page.' To add a recipe, you need to enter the recipe name, category, preparation time, and instructions in the respective fields. Then, select the ingredient you want to add from the ingredient list and enter its quantity. If you prefer, you can also search for the ingredient quickly by typing in a few letters. Finally, once you press the 'Finish' button, the recipe and its ingredients will be successfully added. If the ingredient you want to add is not in the recipe, you can add a new ingredient by filling in the fields on the right side of the screen. To add a new ingredient, simply enter the ingredient name, total quantity, unit, and unit price. Then, you can select the new ingredient from the list and add it to the recipe. You can also go to the 'recipe update' and 'recipe delete' screen from the button on the top right.
